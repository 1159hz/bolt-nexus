   → RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=dummy_secret

Step 5: Deploy

   4. Click "Generate token"
   5. Copy the token
   6. Use token as password when Git asks

Problem: "Repository not found"
Solution: Double-check the repository URL you copied

Problem: "Updates are rejected"
Solution: Run: git pull origin main
          Then try pushing again


COMMON GITHUB TERMS:
--------------------
Repository (Repo): Your project folder on GitHub
Commit: Saving a snapshot of your changes
